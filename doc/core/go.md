# Go in core
Go is quickly gaining popularity among developers, with its great tooling,
focus on microservices, and state-of-the-art standard library.

## Motivation
When choosing the right language for the project, I focused on finding the
right tool for the application and developer experience.

I wanted `notipie` to be a high-performance microservice, so interpreted
languages for the backend were not an option. Python and JavaScript were off
the table.
